                        The University of Queensland Tae Kwon Do Club website is very media heavy with lots of videos and images, but can be hard
                        to view on some screens and with some brightnesses due to the very dark theme. The formatted table with all the download
                        links of the different patterns is very useful and UI friendly, however the red and black theme can be hard to read at times.

                        The Tien Lung Taekwon-Do club has a very interactive website, that has lots of visuals and utilizes in-page jumps, and hover
                        styles. However, the page is mostly contained on one single page, and can be a bit awkward to navigate, and find what you are
                        looking for.

                    <p id="description">
                        I found the Abbotsford Taekwondo club to have a very un-intuitive website, lots of the images (Like the facebook/Instagram)
                        aren't links but just images, as well as the top horizontal navigation list spills over onto the next line. The location page seems
                        to be missing elements completely, and the Contact Us and Taekwondo Affiliation pages unexpectedly link to outside webpage, and mail links.

                        One of the best parts of openclipart is that their <a id="inLink" href="https://openclipart.org/share" target="new">license</a> allows for unlimited commercial use, and they
                        contain a plethora of over 158,000 images for use that is always growing.

                        Although the sounds on the website are free, certain sounds contain usage restrictions for commercial use, however, you are bound to find a sound
                        for whatever you are looking for from common sounds to the very unique.

                        Google fonts allows use for commercial or personal with their open source license; they host very high quality fonts that you can integrate into your
                        website, from the wacky to the most popular they host it all.
