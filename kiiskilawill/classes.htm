                    Self-Defence and team-work. This class is well suited for parents looking to build discipline

                    Study Time is quite different from the rest of the classes. Instructors help with remembering history, learning pattern
                    origins and studying for belt-testings. For more advanced students, instructors help with the theory of breathing, and
                    other advanced topics required for testing.
